# VWPortfolio

## User Story 
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

To complete this challenge I viewed the index.html code, used 2 images;02-portfolio-1.jpg,02-portfolio-2.jpg from the following directory "UNCC-VIRT-FSF-PT-07-2023-U-LOLC/02AdvancedCSS/02Challenge/Main/index.html",  After viewing I made a mockup on paper of how I wanted my styling and made modifications from my notes and tips from in-class sessions.
